<p>Chaos of Operations  </p>

<p>Chaos of operations started as a game developed by Cody Childers
as part of his Master's in Games &amp; Playable media. This is a port
from the original board game form to a browser playable one, done
by Cody Childers and Bennett Roesch.</p>

<p>Rules:  </p>

<p>Setup <br />
This game is best played when each player is sitting side by side at a table. <br />
Each player gets one of the ‘1’ number cards, and places it in front of them. <br />
Each player gets 2 plus operations, 2 minus operations, 2 multiplication operations, 
2 division operations, 1 exponent operation, and 1 modulus operation. For the next 
step, each player gets 10 blank number cards. Decide if you would like to play the 
game on easy, medium, or hard difficulty. <br />
• If you decided on easy, write the numbers 1-10 on the blank number cards in each 
player’s hand.  It will look like the image below, but with the numbers 1-10 for each 
player instead of the large ones from the dice roll. <br />
• If you would like to play on medium, roll the d20 10 times, and write the resulting 
number on one of each player’s cards.  It will also look similar to the image below, 
but with mostly smaller numbers. <br />
• If you have chosen hard, roll the d10 and d% 10 times.  Each time you roll it, sum 
the two numbers and write their values on 2 cards, one belonging to each player. 
For example, if you roll the dice 10 times and get the numbers. <br />
43, 4, 80, 83, 96, 17, 30, 70, 23, and 55, each player should end up with one of the 
formerly blank number cards that has each of those numbers. These numbers get laid 
out on the table in front of each player. Lay out the operation cards by your number 
cards. Finally, take one of the number 1 cards for each player and place them in the 
play area. The player with the most mathematical knowledge moves first.</p>

<p>The Game <br />
Place one of your number cards and one of your operation cards on either your or your 
opponent’s equation. You can insert it anywhere in either equation, provided that it 
is still a valid equation (see images below). The equation will be valid as long as 
there are not 2 number cards or 2 operation cards sequentially.  </p>

<p>Winning <br />
The game finishes when a player starts their turn and does not have any operations or 
numbers to play. Calculate the result of each player’s equation, being careful of the 
order of operations. Remember that you compute the parenthesis first, exponents second, 
multiplication, division, and modulus in the order they appear third, and addition and 
subtraction in the order they appear last. If an equation divides by 0 anywhere, the 
result is to be treated as negative infinity. The player with the largest number at 
the end of the game wins.</p>
